Welcome to the prototype static site for the Gliding New Zealand training pathways. The structure mirrors the staged development journey from first dual flights through advanced endorsements, providing a clean hierarchy for future expansion.

This build uses Hugo with the Book theme so we can focus on content modelling before investing in bespoke styling. As we migrate additional Moodle material we can enrich each section with structured resources, timelines, and downloadable references.
