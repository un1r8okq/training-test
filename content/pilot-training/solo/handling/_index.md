# Aircraft Handling


## Who is in Control?

In flight either the instructor or the trainee pilot will be in control of the glider.  It is not acceptable to have both people in the cockpit trying to control the glider at the same time, and obviously having neither occupant in control is not useful either.  Here is the protocol that is always used whenever instructor and pilot are together in a glider.

Pass:  While in flight show that you can take control and hand back control using the exact phrases given in the PTP notes: “You have Control”, “I have Control”.  Also that you can follow through on the controls with a light touch, and promptly release the controls again when the Instructor says "I have control".
