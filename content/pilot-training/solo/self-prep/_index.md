# Logbook and training record

It is a legal requirement for a pilot to maintain a flying logbook. One is issued to all new club members. The logbook must contain a record of all flights you do and include details of the flight. All authorisations, endorsements and ratings also need to be signed off in your logbook (e.g. Daily Inspection approval, launch method, glider type approval, passenger rating and cross country clearance).  Your instructor will help you to learn how to do this correctly. 

Remember that you must bring your log book with you for all training occasions.  

The training record is a great tool to help keep track of your training progress, but it is a secondary document to your log book. It should be kept with your log book and available at all times for your instructors.  The checklists can be added as "loose leaf entries" in your log book (ask your instructor about this).

Once a section has been completed, a copy should be submitted to your CFI and filed to ensure the club has training records on file.

Pass: shows the instructor a neatly filled-in Logbook and Solo Pilot Training Record with all details correct and up-to-date.

# Airfield and Safety Rules

Print out the local Aerodrome Chart from your Club website.  A sample is attached for Matamata.  Identify runways and landing areas.  Vehicle speed limit 20 kph to minimise damage to grass and roads.  A gliding site does have hazards, and will have a Safety Briefing to identify these to visitors.  Standard Operating Procedures need to be read and understood.  These documents will be on your Club website.

Pass:  carries own copy of Aerodrome Chart.  Has reviewed available airfield safety documents.  Complies with gliding field operations.
