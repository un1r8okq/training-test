# Circuit and Landing


## Circuit - Standard Pattern

There is a "standard"pattern for all aircraft operating at aerodromes in NZ - refer to Standard Aerodrome Procedures below. 

In NZ gliders join at 1,000 feet above ground at the start of the downwind leg.  Some flexibility is allowed for different aircraft types and weather conditions, but a standard joining height helps to see-and-avoid other aircraft joining at the same time.  Refer to Pilot Manual Glider Circuits.

The main objective of every glider circuit is to complete the turn onto final at a satisfactory height, speed and distance from the landing point.  From this position it is much easier to make a good landing.  A good circuit also keeps options open as long as possible.

Pilots need to judge height in the circuit without reference to the altimeter, and judge position without reference to landmarks (except for the landing spot itself).

Pass:  Pilot understands the standard rectangular circuit and demonstrates a well-proportioned circuit (with respect to both height and track) with the altimeter blanked off.  Consider using a non-standard circuit or checking at a different airfield so that familiar landmarks are not available.
