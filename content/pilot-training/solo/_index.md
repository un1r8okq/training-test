# Getting to Solo Pilot

Welcome to the Gliding NZ Pilot Training Program.  Our objective is to provide a safe and efficient path for you to become a competent glider pilot in New Zealand, and to present a vision for what is possible in this very exciting sport.

Open and print the check list below, and use this to guide and monitor your progress towards achieving Stage 1: Solo Pilot.

The program assumes you will study the material linked directly from this web site.  The "Recommended Reading" books are supplementary to this.  Documents specific to your gliding site will be found on your Gliding Club web site.  For example, the airfield chart, local operating rules, standard operating procedures (SOP's) and local landmarks and reporting points.

Head to the [Self-Preparation](./self-preparation/) module to work through the ground-based tasks before flying the lessons below.

## Training Record Checkboxes Explained

1. Self-Prepared: The pilot signs this check-box when they have read and are familiar with the topic as presented in these notes.  This may involve mentally rehearsing a manoeuvre over and over until it is thoroughly familiar, memorising a check-list or understanding a concept like "effects of controls". 

2. Reviewed: A review normally means discussing with an instructor to make sure you are clear on the main points of the topic. This may be followed by a demonstration in flight, and you can try the exercise for yourself.  This would be followed by a debriefing after the flight. The instructor signs this check-box to indicate that you have an adequate understanding of what it is about.

3. Completed: Most check-boxes have pass criteria. When the pilot has achieved the pass standard the instructor will sign this check-box. This check-box may be signed after the first satisfactory demonstration, but further practice is usually needed.

### Australia
_Australian Gliding Knowledge_, updated in 2019 by [Gliding Australia](http://www.glidingaustralia.org/), is very relevant to gliding in New Zealand.  There are a few small differences such as the check lists and low-tow position.  Start reading at Page 32.

Winch Launch Manual, published by Gliding Australia, is required reading for all pilots launching by winch.  Available on [the Gliding Australia web site](http://doc.glidingaustralia.org/index.php?option=com_docman&view=download&alias=1598-winch-launch-manual-ops-0007&category_slug=manuals&Itemid=101).

### North America
_[Glider Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/glider_handbook)_, published in 2013 by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Big files but good pictures.  Download the full version at 48 MB or chapter by chapter as required.  

_Stick and Rudder_ - An Explanation of the Art of Flying by Wolfgang Langewiesche was first published in 1944 and remains one of the most lucid texts on the why an aircraft flies, and how to operate the controls.  Every serious pilot should have this little book.
